# -AWSJava
fetching data from random open API and sending them to the AWS S3 Bucket for comparison. Ex: collecting ratings in the movies. 

In order to run the server we have to download the main.java file and run it. Once the server starts running, then we have to run the client_request.java file for requesting the server for information that we are expecting.

However, this server stops running for now because I push my AWS S3. But if I tune up my S3 bucket it will start again.
